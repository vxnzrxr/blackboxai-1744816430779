It allows users to register as either mentors or mentees, navigate through a user-friendly interface, and schedule mentoring sessions seamlessly. The application emphasizes learning through expert guidance, offering features such as flexible scheduling, an intuitive feedback system, and user dashboards for both mentors and mentees.
